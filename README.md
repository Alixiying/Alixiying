- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alixiying
- 👀 I am currently studying for a Master's degree in Applied Statistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer vision.
- 💞️ I’m interesting in working as an algorithm engineer or a data scientist, and would like to work in that field.
- 📫 I will open source some of the code written during the learning process and some of the program models that are publicly available from the research work.

Welcome to improve my code !
